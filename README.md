## Statistical Analysis Report

This directory contains a statistical analysis report comparing the time efficiency and success/failure rates between two approaches: "Amir" and "Mine". The report presents the experimental design, hypothesis testing, calculations, and results for both factors.

## Abstract

The abstract provides a summary of the report, highlighting the purpose of the analysis and the main findings. It mentions the significance level used for hypothesis testing.

## Introduction

The introduction section introduces the context and objectives of the report. It explains the goal of evaluating and comparing the time efficiency and success/failure rates between the "Amir" and "Mine" approaches.

## Experimental Design

The experimental design section outlines the parameters of the experiment, including the map configurations, numbers of tokens, and the number of tests conducted. It provides essential information about the data collection process.

## Time Efficiency Analysis

This section presents the analysis of time efficiency for both the "Amir" and "Mine" approaches. It includes the statistical parameters, such as sample sizes, means, and standard deviations. The section also describes the hypothesis testing process, calculations performed (e.g., pooled standard deviation, t-value, degrees of freedom), and the results obtained. The conclusion regarding the significant difference in time efficiency is discussed.

## Success/Failure Rates Analysis

The success/failure rates analysis section focuses on comparing the performance of the "Amir" and "Mine" approaches based on success and failure counts. It describes the hypothesis testing process, calculations performed (e.g., success rates, observed difference, standard error, Chi-Square value), and the results obtained. The conclusion about the difference in success rates is discussed, highlighting the lack of significant variation between the approaches.

## Conclusion

The conclusion section summarizes the main findings and conclusions drawn from the analysis. It highlights the contrasting performance of the "Amir" and "Mine" approaches in terms of time efficiency while addressing the lack of substantial variation in success rates.
